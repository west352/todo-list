## Todo-list Application
The main purpose of the project is to practice using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Model-view-controller software architectural pattern to build a basic front-end application.  
It could be used as a temporary todo-list reminder.  
There is another version of this application built by React and Redux with additional features available in my github repository.  

### Features
- Add a todo item into the list of todo-items.
- Toggle a todo item if it is finished. The finished todo item will be shown in grey color and crossed out with a line.
- Toggle all the items in the todo list by clicking the checkbox beside adding a new todo item input field.
- A todo item can also be deleted from the list.
- Delete all the todo items in the list by pressing the "DELETE ALL" button at the bottom. The window will alert the user to confirm the action.
- The application also supports mobile users. 

### Usage
- The applicaton can be directly accessed in browser through the URL: west352.github.io/todo-list/
- The application can be cloned to user's local computer and viewd or modified through any code editor such as VSCode.
- Make sure to download the Node.js runtime environment on your local machine, if you want to modify the application in a code editor.
